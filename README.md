# dsfuncs
Functions/Classes/Programs I have created for (hopefully) general use purposes for data-sciencers. 

These are all functions/classes/programs that I started writing during my time in the Galvanize data
science program. They are for the most part functions built for convenience. I hope that I'm not the only 
one that will find these useful, but that other data-sciencers can find ways to make these useful, and/or 
to update and upgrade them. Please feel free to shoot me an email or pull request. Data-sciencers are only 
as good as the tools we provide each other.
